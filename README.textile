<p><strong>My Version of a robotlegs-clock
  </strong></p>
<p>After  seeing vizio360’s clock I thought I should have my own customizable robotlegs -  clock.</p>
<p>
  I used vizio360’s  Timer, but a different robotlegs-configuration.</p>
<p>
  The clock‘s  look is as3-generated and hence customizable.</p>
<p>
  It is a  work in progress...</p>
